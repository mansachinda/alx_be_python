# Variables containing principal, rate, and time values
principal = 1000 # representing $1000
rate = 0.05 # representing 5% annual interest rate
time = 3 # representing 3 years

# Calculates the Simple Interest of PRT
Interest = principal * rate * time
# Prints the result of Simple Interest
print("The simple interest is:", Interest)
